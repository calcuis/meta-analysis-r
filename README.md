# meta-analysis-r
an example of R code for conducting a meta-analysis

```
# Load the metafor package
library(metafor)

# Define the function for performing a meta-analysis
perform_meta_analysis <- function(data) {
  # Loop over the data
  for (i in 1:length(data)) {
    # If this is the first iteration, simply store the effect size and sample size
    if (i == 1) {
      combined_effect_size <- data[[i]]$effect_size
      combined_sample_size <- data[[i]]$sample_size
    } else {
      # Otherwise, combine the effect size and sample size with the previous values
      combined_effect_size <- rma.uni(yi=combined_effect_size, ni=combined_sample_size,
                                      yi=data[[i]]$effect_size, ni=data[[i]]$sample_size)$yi
      combined_sample_size <- rma.uni(yi=combined_effect_size, ni=combined_sample_size,
                                      yi=data[[i]]$effect_size, ni=data[[i]]$sample_size)$ni
    }
  }

  # Return the combined effect size and sample size
  return(list(effect_size=combined_effect_size, sample_size=combined_sample_size))
}
```

In this code, we first load the `metafor` package, which contains the necessary functions for performing a meta-analysis.

Next, we define the function `perform_meta_analysis`, which takes in a single argument: the data to be analyzed.

Inside the function, we loop over the data and use the `rma.uni` function from the `metafor` package to combine the effect size and sample size for each study.

Finally, we return the combined effect size and sample size. These values can be used to assess the overall effect size and significance of the results of the meta-analysis.
